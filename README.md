# ☕ Leo's Cafe

A full stack cafe management web application built as a side project to refresh and strengthen my software development skills after NS.

The system simulates a real cafe platform where users can browse menus, place orders ahead of time, earn and redeem loyalty rewards, make table reservations, and manage their accounts securely.
